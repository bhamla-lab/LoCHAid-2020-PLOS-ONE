The bottom case is denoted by different degrees of taper - if there is wanting of a very tight fit of the top and bottom cases - use 3.5 degree taper file (NEW 3.5 deg bottom.stl). For semi-tight use the (NEW 3 deg bottom.stl). For just a bit of it use the (NEW 2.5 deg bottom.stl). We recommend the 3 degree taper.
